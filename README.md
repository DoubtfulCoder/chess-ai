# Chess-AI

A chess AI I made using javascript. Uses the following algorithms:
- Minimax
- Alpha-beta pruning
- Multithreading / web workers
- Matrix map of optimal squares for each piece
- Heuristic evaluation of positions through material
- Quiescence search
- MVV/LVA (Most Valuable Victim - Least Valuable Aggressor) optimization
- Null-move pruning/heursitic (TODO)
- Iterative deepening (OTODO)
- Killer heuristic (TODO)
- Transposition table and Zobrist Hashing (TODO)
